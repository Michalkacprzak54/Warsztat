# Car Workshop – Web Application  

## 📖 Project Description  
The **Car Workshop** project is a web application designed for managing repairs, customers, and vehicles. The system allows users to add new repair orders, which are then visible to employees. Employees can process repair requests independently, adding descriptions of completed work. The application also enables tracking the status of repairs and reviewing repair history. Additionally, the system allows for managing customer and vehicle data. An **Administrator role** is available with access to an admin panel where they can manage employees, parts, and repairs (CRUD operations).
